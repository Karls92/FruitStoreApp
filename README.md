# Fruit_Store
## Is a simple app to buy fruits. It contains a product list available in the store (this list is static, there isn't a functionality to update this product list), a shopping cart and a payment form where the purchase proccess finished. You can select some fruits and see the price of each fruit, the subtotal and the total money you have to pay. The payment button finishes the purchase proccess and reset all the app to its default values.
